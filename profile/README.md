## Welcome to the official IDMEFv2 standardisation efforts Git Hub

   The Incident Detection Message Exchange Format version 2 (IDMEFv2)
   provides a way to describe any incidents detected on cyber and/or
   physical infrastructures.

   The format is agnostic so it can be used in standalone or combined
   cyber (SIEM), physical (PSIM) and availability (NMS) monitoring
   systems.  IDMEFv2 can also be used to describe cyber and physical
   potential threats (CTI/PTI).

   IDMEFv2 improves situational awareness by facilitating correlation of
   multiple types of events using the same base format thus enabling
   efficient detection of complex and combined cyber and physical
   attacks on critical infrastructures.
   
   This GitHub hosts technical tools and librairies implementing IDMEFV2 as well
   as IDMEFv2 official IETF Internet Drafts.
