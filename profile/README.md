## Welcome to the official IDMEFv2 standardisation efforts Git Hub

   The Incident Detection Message Exchange Format version 2 (IDMEFv2) is a universal format to describe any events and incidents happening on cyber and/or
   physical infrastructures.

   It's agnostic so it can be used in stand-alone or combined cyber (SIEM), physical (PSIM) and availability (NMS) monitoring
   systems.  IDMEFv2 can also be used to describe cyber and physical potential threats (CTI/PTI).
